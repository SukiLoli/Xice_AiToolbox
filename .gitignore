# Playwright-specific (downloaded browsers)
# Playwright typically downloads browsers outside the project directory,
# but if for some reason they end up inside, these might be useful.
# However, the primary browser cache is usually global.

# Specific to your project structure / potentially sensitive user data
# If USER_DATA_DIRECTORY_PATH in google_search_plugin.py points to a path *inside* the project
# (which is NOT recommended), you would ignore that specific path.
# But generally, user data directories are outside the project.

# Example of ignoring a specific user data path if it were inside (NOT typical)
